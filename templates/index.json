The iconic structure of the Kasai uses a special insulating material that reflects heat back into the grill, allowing for a consistent temperature throughout cooking.

Binchotan produces inimitable smokiness when cooking, without the traditional BBQ’s bitter and burnt flavours. Once finished, the coals can be cooled, left to dry and used again.",

We can offer you replacement tiles, and the old ones can be ground and used by gardeners. They’re an effective soil conditioner that can loosen compacted soil, provide drainage, and hold three to four times its weight in water.",
